Covid-19 Travel App

Welcome to Coroamer. The app that is built for international travel safety for the Coronavirus pandemic.

The aim of this app was to share, with travellers, the restrictions of each European country and what they would need to do to be assured entry and a safe stay.

The frontend of Coroamer was created using React Native in a team of 5 for our final project at Northcoders.

A demo of the roject can be viewed online here: https://vimeo.com/613381739
